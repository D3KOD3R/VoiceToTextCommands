# Waitlist Ideas

This document captures marketable feature ideas we can revisit later via the GUI’s **Waitlist issues** bucket.

- **Voice-first incident tracker** – capture bugs, feature ideas, and QA notes by voice across every repo, then auto-sync them to GitHub or Notion via a “follow-up” action.
- **Project sampler** – organize multi-repo recordings so users can switch narrated contexts without losing the previously selected repository’s backlog.
- **Realtime collaborator view** – stream the waterfall output + log to a shared web view while the narrator’s microphone is live, making remote teams feel like a “pair programming podcast.”
- **Hotkey “Coach” workflows** – layer guidance cues (e.g., “next issue,” “priority,” “blocking”) into the hotkey experience and convert them into structured issue metadata for agile stories.
- **Marketable analytics** – track recording count, ping times, and transcription success per repo so we can pitch the product to teams that need compliance-ready voice documentation.
