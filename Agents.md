# Agents Overview

This file is the entrypoint for guidance. It points to individual agent documents stored in the `agents/` folder. Consult them in order for consistent behavior. Do not skip any relevant agent;
refer to the VOICE_ISSUE_WORKFLOW.md file when working through issues, if the user gives you a fix issues command. 

Order of consultation:
1) `agents/AgentVoice.md` — user voice notes from working on UI and feature tests
2) `agents/AgentUx.md` — user experience
3) `agents/AgentInstall.md` — installation & packaging
4) `agents/AgentConfig.md` — configuration defaults & migration
5) `agents/AgentPersistence.md` — persistence & safety
6) `agents/AgentCode.md` — code style & dependencies
7) `agents/AgentUi.md` — desktop UI specifics
8) `agents/AgentTest.md` — testing & verification
9) `agents/AgentFeatures.md` — features catalog
10) `agents/AgentBug.md` — bug/issue tracking workflow
