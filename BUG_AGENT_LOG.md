| GUI-001 | 2025-12-13T20:05:00Z | feat/gui-component-blocks | 3161838fde747f7363755f95d4f0421155ab409a | Waterfall viewport missing; user cannot see microphone waterfall spanning full width. | Verified fixed by component refactor/grid layout (user confirmation 2025-12-13). |
| GUI-002 | 2025-12-13T17:59:22Z | feat/gui-component-blocks | 815cda41a5c02f3b0b470f768d6ab65811e51623 | Issue list lacks numeric captions; user needs numbered labels matching spoken “issue 1/2/3”. | Fixed in working tree – headers now show live counts per bucket. |
| STT-001 | 2025-12-13T17:59:22Z | feat/gui-component-blocks | 815cda41a5c02f3b0b470f768d6ab65811e51623 | Saying “issue 2/3/4” is not treated as a new entry; transcript parser fails to split, also speech output panel stays empty. | Fixed in working tree – parser honors “issue N” and GUI logs local transcripts. |
| GUI-003 | 2025-12-13T17:59:22Z | feat/gui-component-blocks | 815cda41a5c02f3b0b470f768d6ab65811e51623 | Issue bucket columns do not stretch across the view; pending/completed/waitlist panes stay narrow. | Fixed 2025-12-13T18:24:00Z - issues panel now spans the full top row and controls sit beneath it. |
| GUI-004 | 2025-12-13T17:59:22Z | feat/gui-component-blocks | 815cda41a5c02f3b0b470f768d6ab65811e51623 | Apply settings button too small; user wants large square-style action. | Fixed in working tree – Apply button moved to a full-width CTA under paths. |
| GUI-005 | 2025-12-13T17:59:22Z | feat/gui-component-blocks | 815cda41a5c02f3b0b470f768d6ab65811e51623 | Duplicate "Test Selected Mic" button near waterfall should be removed (top button already exists). | Fixed in working tree - removed lower duplicate button. |
| PROC-002 | 2025-12-13T18:17:04Z | feat/gui-component-blocks | 815cda41a5c02f3b0b470f768d6ab65811e51623 | After resolving tasks, `.voice/voice-issues.md` entries remain unchecked. | Fixed 2025-12-13T18:24:00Z - checklist updated and workflow noted to keep marking items. |
| GUI-006 | 2025-12-13T19:06:51Z | feat/gui-component-blocks | 2e353a1 | Layout needs to match the latest mock: top controls inside the red span, level meter/ready inside the black span with the live speech output panel, and the waterfall should sit immediately below the recording controls. | Fixed 2025-12-13T19:15:10Z - live-level span, live speech output, and layout updates complete. |
| GUI-007 | 2025-12-13T19:27:04Z | feat/gui-component-blocks | 869e020 | Bucket entries aren't editable; double-click should allow in-place editing and persistence. | Fixed 2025-12-13T19:27:04Z - introduced dialog that saves edited text back to the issues file. |
| REPO-001 | 2025-12-23T01:19:14Z | main | e92647a935c0ebccd35d388fcdb095ea980232e6 | Switching the app to another repo does not persist recent repos locally, so the history list is lost. | Fixed in working tree - repo selection now records history when valid repos are chosen. |
| GIT-001 | 2025-12-23T01:19:14Z | main | e92647a935c0ebccd35d388fcdb095ea980232e6 | Missing automation to gitignore per-user/temp files generated by the app (repo history, logs, local lists). | Fixed in working tree - added gitignore rules source + sync helper and updated .gitignore. |
| FLOW-001 | 2025-12-23T01:19:14Z | main | e92647a935c0ebccd35d388fcdb095ea980232e6 | When targeting another repo, "fix issues" lacks the voice-issue workflow/agent logic and does not point back to the running VoiceIssues program. | Fixed in working tree - repo prep now seeds voice workflow docs and agent entrypoint hint. |
| TEST-001 | 2025-12-23T02:00:27Z | main | e92647a935c0ebccd35d388fcdb095ea980232e6 | No automated test agent or smoke test runner to validate core flows. | Fixed in working tree - added smoke test runner + AgentTestAutomation. |
| REPO-002 | 2025-12-23T02:00:27Z | main | e92647a935c0ebccd35d388fcdb095ea980232e6 | External repo footprint should be limited to a `voiceissues` folder with guidance/agent/gitignore only, plus a local test repo fixture. | Fixed in working tree - voiceissues-only repo prep + test repo fixture added. |
| FLOW-002 | 2025-12-23T03:19:10Z | feat/voiceissues-test-automation | 99bbe37ef5b851ddd504ffcb16497949db738c11 | Voiceissues workflow guidance does not require Codex to resolve every item or tick completed items. | Fixed in working tree - workflow + agent now require per-item resolution and ticking. |
| FLOW-003 | 2025-12-23T11:09:09Z | main | 115bdf86665dc0dad2fd4a364b8ea0d6c2785d86 | codex_review_issues helpers always point at `.voice/voice-issues.md`, so when the user switches repos the agent still loads the original workflow and keeps asking clarifying questions. | Fixed in working tree - added scripts/resolve_voice_issues.py and updated codex_review_issues.* to resolve the repo-local issues file (accepting `--repo` overrides) via `.voice_config.json`. |
| GUI-008 | 2025-12-23T03:19:10Z | feat/voiceissues-test-automation | 99bbe37ef5b851ddd504ffcb16497949db738c11 | The static info strip (green) should move down and remove its green background. | Fixed in working tree - info strip moved to settings panel and uses neutral background. |
| GUI-009 | 2025-12-23T04:04:03Z | feat/voiceissues-test-automation | 99bbe37ef5b851ddd504ffcb16497949db738c11 | Auto-select after delete only highlights the first line of a wrapped issue. | Fixed in working tree - auto-select now expands selection across wrapped lines. |
| CFG-001 | 2025-12-23T04:04:03Z | feat/voiceissues-test-automation | 99bbe37ef5b851ddd504ffcb16497949db738c11 | Selected input device is not remembered between runs. | Fixed in working tree - last selected device persisted to config and restored. |
| NOTIF-001 | 2025-12-23T04:04:03Z | feat/voiceissues-test-automation | 99bbe37ef5b851ddd504ffcb16497949db738c11 | No completion notification when a repo's pending issues reach zero. | Fixed in working tree - chime/log emitted on pending-to-zero transition. |
| UI-010 | 2025-12-23T04:04:03Z | feat/voiceissues-test-automation | 99bbe37ef5b851ddd504ffcb16497949db738c11 | Deleted issues cannot be undone or archived; no empty-archive control. | Fixed in working tree - archive + undo delete + empty archive implemented. |
| UI-011 | 2025-12-23T04:04:03Z | feat/voiceissues-test-automation | 99bbe37ef5b851ddd504ffcb16497949db738c11 | Multi-select drag only moves one issue at a time. | Fixed in working tree - drag now honors the live selection after clicking so ctrl/shift selections and deselection toggles stay intact. |
| UI-012 | 2025-12-23T04:07:51Z | feat/voiceissues-test-automation | 99bbe37ef5b851ddd504ffcb16497949db738c11 | Undo delete only ever restores the last batch; there's no way to step back through older deletions. | Fixed in working tree - undo delete now reserves archived batches in a stack so each button press pops the next level (remaining counts logged). |
| REPO-003 | 2025-12-23T04:07:51Z | feat/voiceissues-test-automation | 99bbe37ef5b851ddd504ffcb16497949db738c11 | Selecting a different repo reverts to the prior repo when clicking issue buckets, instead of staying on the new repo. | Fixed in working tree - config migration no longer forces defaultRepo to local. |
| UI-013 | 2025-12-23T13:50:00Z | feat/voiceissues-test-automation | 99bbe37ef5b851ddd504ffcb16497949db738c11 | Dragged issues disappear once dropped and there is no `Ctrl+Z` undo. | Fixed in working tree - drag operations push the sanitized file snapshot to an undo stack and `Ctrl+Z` restores that state. |
| UI-014 | 2025-12-23T06:11:42Z | feat/voiceissues-test-automation | 99bbe37ef5b851ddd504ffcb16497949db738c11 | No `Ctrl+D` shortcut to delete the current selection in the issues buckets. | Fixed in working tree - `Ctrl+D` now triggers delete-selected when a bucket has focus/selection. |
| UI-015 | 2025-12-23T06:11:42Z | feat/voiceissues-test-automation | 99bbe37ef5b851ddd504ffcb16497949db738c11 | Input device dropdown text is hard to read in dark mode due to conflicting background/foreground colors. | Fixed in working tree - combobox + dropdown list now use dark palette background/foreground + selection colors. |
| UI-016 | 2025-12-23T06:11:42Z | feat/voiceissues-test-automation | 99bbe37ef5b851ddd504ffcb16497949db738c11 | Input device dropdown is too wide and should be tightened to match the provided reference image. | Fixed in working tree - device combobox width reduced and no longer stretches. |
| UI-017 | 2025-12-23T06:11:42Z | feat/voiceissues-test-automation | 99bbe37ef5b851ddd504ffcb16497949db738c11 | "Test Selected Mic" + "Refresh" buttons should move left to sit beside the hotkeys static text row. | Fixed in working tree - action buttons moved beside the hotkeys info line. |
| UI-018 | 2025-12-23T06:11:42Z | feat/voiceissues-test-automation | 99bbe37ef5b851ddd504ffcb16497949db738c11 | Waterfall window should move upward into the new purple-highlighted area to free space for the log. | Fixed in working tree - waterfall panel moved into settings row; log moved into bottom section. |
| UI-019 | 2025-12-23T06:21:14Z | feat/voiceissues-test-automation | 99bbe37ef5b851ddd504ffcb16497949db738c11 | Ctrl+Z only undoes drags; it should tie into a global action log and undo deletes/moves/edits. | Fixed in working tree - undo stack now captures drag, delete, edit, reorder, remove-duplicate, and state changes. |
| UI-020 | 2025-12-23T06:25:34Z | feat/voiceissues-test-automation | 99bbe37ef5b851ddd504ffcb16497949db738c11 | Codex progress is invisible; issues should show `[working on]` while a task is active. | Fixed in working tree - workflow + scripts now require updating the active issue to `[working on]` while in progress and reverting to `[x]` on completion. |
| UI-021 | 2025-12-23T06:25:34Z | feat/voiceissues-test-automation | 99bbe37ef5b851ddd504ffcb16497949db738c11 | Buckets do not refresh automatically when the issues file changes on disk. | Fixed in working tree - added periodic file mtime polling to refresh the lists. |
| UI-022 | 2025-12-23T06:38:26Z | feat/voiceissues-test-automation | 99bbe37ef5b851ddd504ffcb16497949db738c11 | Selecting items in one bucket should deselect items in other buckets unless Ctrl is held. | Fixed in working tree - primary clicks clear other bucket selections unless Ctrl is pressed. |
| UI-023 | 2025-12-23T06:38:26Z | feat/voiceissues-test-automation | 99bbe37ef5b851ddd504ffcb16497949db738c11 | Clicking a selected issue again should deselect it, but it still stays highlighted. | Fixed in working tree - explicit selection handling now clears the single-entry selection on repeat click. |
| UI-024 | 2025-12-23T07:42:58Z | feat/voiceissues-test-automation | 99bbe37ef5b851ddd504ffcb16497949db738c11 | Input device field should be slightly longer and mic action buttons should sit inline beside it. | Fixed in working tree - device combo widened and Test/Refresh moved inline with the device row. |
| UI-025 | 2025-12-23T07:42:58Z | feat/voiceissues-test-automation | 99bbe37ef5b851ddd504ffcb16497949db738c11 | Waterfall window should gain more space after moving mic action buttons. | Fixed in working tree - waterfall canvas height increased to reclaim space. |
| UI-029 | 2025-12-23T11:37:27Z | main | 115bdf86665dc0dad2fd4a364b8ea0d6c2785d86 | Voice assistant should load a repo alias on voice command so we can switch workspaces without manual repo selection. | Fixed in working tree - `voice_issue_daemon.py` now recognizes `load repo <alias>`, updates `.voice_config.json`/`.voice/repo_history.json`, and continues processing the remaining transcript so the next `fix issues` run follows the requested repo. |
| UI-026 | 2025-12-23T08:05:05Z | feat/voiceissues-test-automation | 99bbe37ef5b851ddd504ffcb16497949db738c11 | Dragging a multi-selected set collapses the selection and the highlight disappears, so multiple issues are not moved together and repeat clicks deselect the selection. | Fixed 2025-12-23T08:05:05Z - `_handle_listbox_primary_click` now ignores the clear/select when the clicked row is already part of a multi-selection and keeps the highlight until the drag completes. |
| UI-027 | 2025-12-23T10:06:06Z | main | main | The start/stop control, waterfall space, and static helper strings should match the new mock so the recorder interface feels less cluttered. | Fixed 2025-12-23T10:06:06Z - consolidated the record toggle button, removed the static helper strip, enlarged the waterfall, and expanded the log area in `voice_gui_app.py`/`voice_gui_layout.py`. |
| UI-028 | 2025-12-23T10:34:05Z | main | main | Record button width should align with the microphone/waterfall edge and live inside the same container so the controls shrink uniformly. | Fixed 2025-12-23T10:34:05Z - made the settings columns equal width, containerized the record toggle row, and ensured the button stretches to the mic edge while respecting the container sizing in `voice_gui_layout.py`/`voice_gui_app.py`. |
| UI-030 | 2025-12-23T12:03:30Z | main | 115bdf86665dc0dad2fd4a364b8ea0d6c2785d86 | Align the Start Recording button, waterfall, and log with the green/blue/purple/red sections from the reference so the controls, audio view, and log spacing match the mock. | Fixed in working tree - the settings panel now packs the control rows in a single container, the Start Recording button has a fixed width, the waterfall canvas height was increased, and log weights/height grow to fill the freed column (see `voice_gui_app.py`/`voice_gui_layout.py`). |
| UI-031 | 2025-12-25T13:29:04Z | main | 115bdf86665dc0dad2fd4a364b8ea0d6c2785d86 | Waterfall panel still does not stretch left to match the mock; the right-side canvas needs to start further left. | Fixed in working tree - right column now expands and waterfall padding no longer offsets the canvas from the section edge. |
