# AgentFeatures — README Feature Sync

Purpose: When a user-facing feature is added or changed, update the feature list in `README.md` under “What it does” (or a dedicated Features section). Keep this agent as instructions only; do not duplicate the feature list here. Always consult this when altering features and state that you followed it; do not skip.

Process:
1) Add/modify feature bullets in `README.md` (brief what/how).
2) Ensure ordering and wording stay concise and user-facing.
3) Avoid diverging copies; the source of truth for the feature list is the README.
