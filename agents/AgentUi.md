# AGENT_UI — Desktop UI

- Show full device names, selected device, and live input level.
- Minimal layout: title, repo/issues paths, device picker, level meter, start/stop, status/log.
- Default actions should be obvious (Start Recording, Stop & Transcribe).
- Keep spacing and text readable; avoid clutter, truncate nothing important.
- Always apply these UI rules on any desktop UI change and mention that this agent guided the update.
