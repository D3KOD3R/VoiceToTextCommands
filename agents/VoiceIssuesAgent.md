# VoiceIssues Agent - Repo-Local Guidance

Purpose: keep Codex focused on the repo-local voice issues workflow stored under `voiceissues/`.

Use these files:
- `voiceissues/voice-issues.md` as the task list.
- `voiceissues/VOICE_ISSUE_WORKFLOW.md` for the workflow steps.
- `voiceissues/.gitignore` to keep local artifacts out of git.

Workflow:
1) List outstanding items from `voiceissues/voice-issues.md`.
2) Apply fixes, then change `[ ]` to `[x]` with a short note.
3) Do not delete items without user confirmation.
