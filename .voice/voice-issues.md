- [x] There should be when the voice is created, there should be also a copy of the... I should be a copy of voice issue workflow M.D. (Fixed: creating a voice file now copies `VOICE_ISSUE_WORKFLOW.md` into the repo's `.voice` folder.)
- [x] The other issue is when a new branch is selected, when the user clicks create voice file, the pending issues and completed issues and the wait list issues buckets should all be pointed to that newly created voice file in the new repo. The point of this function is to make it easier for the user to use this application to expedite their coding process so they can be clicking through issues on an application and just talk into their microphone without having to exit out between into the CLI and that's pretty much it. (Fixed: the Create voice file action now updates `repo_cfg`, reloads the issue lists, and refreshes the GUI so every bucket points at the new repo's `.voice/voice-issues.md`.)
- [ ] - [ ] , I want a stop break that if the user says and issues in the recording stops and it starts transcribing those issues. I want you to think about this and tell me if this is possible with the current workflow, or do I need to set up the local repo to do this?
- [ ] , I want you to try and make things a little bit more modern. I want you to make the user interface more modern looking. This is for developers. So it should have a dark mode and maybe, I don't know, maybe generate some... I think they're called SJVs or the little images that are made out of shapes. So for the create voice file button, maybe do like a little picture of a person speaking. Just a little tiny image of a person speaking next to the button. Also, I want you
- [ ] I want you to really flesh out the microphone waterfall and make it look a lot cooler. Put a lot more work into this. It's really quite boring and dull at the moment. I want you to look at some of the coolest waterfall repos on GitHub and just see what's out there. Shop around and see if you can adopt a cooler waterfall. The next thing I want you to do for now,
- [ ] , is I want you to just delete the live speech output window. But don't delete any of the code behind it. We still want to build this out later. And that's it for now.
- [ ] I also want a dark mode option that the user can turn dark mode on and off.

- [ ] One more issue. I want you to think about this application as a whole and think about how this might actually be a marketable product. All of those features that you can think of, I want you to put those in the wait list issues bucket so that we can come back to them later.
- [x] - [ ] I want you to make sure that when the user asks fix issues the program should not consider the already finished issues that are in the completed issues list. If it just gets straight past or they're not going to be checked off and start working on the pending issues. I just want to say on it, it actually didn't start working on the pending issues because they were time listed. They're already not off, like I said, with fix issues. So I want you to fix this. I want you to make sure that the program sticks out with fix issues and describes the pending issues and starts working on those instead. (Resolved: `codex_review_issues.sh` now filters out completed entries so fix-issues runs only mention pending/waitlist items.)
- [x] , I want a check for duplicates function that looks at all the issues listed. And if there are any duplicates listed, it counts the delete function and will delete the duplicates. And it will tell you how many duplicates they are. This is because sometimes the user might have two windows open and then they actually double generating voice issues into the files. So I just want to have a check duplicates button. We can deal with the runtime functions later because the user might want to have multiple windows open. [BLANK_AUDIO] (Added a “Remove duplicates” control that rewrites the issues file to drop duplicate entries and logs how many were removed.)
