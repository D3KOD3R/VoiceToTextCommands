- [x] One more issue. I want you to think about this application as a whole and think about how this might actually be a marketable product. All of those features that you can think of, I want you to put those in the wait list issues bucket so that we can come back to them later. (Captured focused product/market ideas in `WAITLIST_IDEAS.md` and noted how the Waitlist bucket works in `README.md`, so the backlog now explicitly stores those marketing concepts.)
- [x] One of the points is that it doesn't automatically detect or redirect the issues file. It should update the issues file in the issues file selection time, as well as the static. (Implemented `_on_repo_path_value_changed` so the issues path is refreshed as soon as the repo path edits, keeping the static info/hint in sync with the detected `.voice/voice-issues.md`.)
- [x] Again, this issue is if the user selects a new repo path or browsers to a new repo path, the application automatically updates to point to the issues file if it exists in that newly selected repo and if not, it suggests to create a new one. This is to reduce the amount of clicks that the user has to do in predicting or picking that voice file. So I can see that existing voice/voice issues MD detected that voice issues MD using that file, the hint shows up, but the hint doesn't show the actual repo name, so the full path of the file should be shown in the existing hint. So the full path should be repo name dot voice/voice issues, etc. (Hint text now exposes the resolved path and the repo-specific `.voice/voice-issues.md`, so users see the full file path and know when to create a new one.)
