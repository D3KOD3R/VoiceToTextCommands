- [x] Preserve multi-selection state when dragging and clicking within the issue buckets so Ctrl/Drag stays highlighted and repeated clicks toggle selection without losing the other entries. (Fixed in voice_gui_app.py)
- [~] Expand the voice assistant into a "workspace switcher" that can load a repo alias, refresh `.voice/voice-issues.md`, and highlight the right history simply by saying "load repo X" so we can jump between projects hands-free.
- [~] Build a "live verbal code review" mode that narrates recent diffs or summarizes a branch when prompted, surfaces outstanding issues, and lets us open the relevant files straight from the log.
- [~] Ship a "guided voice pairing" workflow that listens for phrases like "review this bug," records the transcript, and ties it into a new or existing issue/PR comment automatically.
- [~] Add multimodal issue capture (audio + screenshot/sketch) so we can describe UI problems verbally and record annotated markdown with attached imagery in one go.
- [~] Provide voice persona profiles (mentor, reviewer, poking) so the interface responds in the chosen tone/style, guiding our work with tailored verbosity and behavioural cues.
- [x] I can't hit select one issue by clicking on an issue in any of the buckets. I should be able to deselect that issue by clicking on it again, so that needs to be fixed. I need to be able to click on an issue. It will illuminate and then if I click on the illuminated issue again, it will un-illuminate that issue. (Fixed: click handling now manages selection explicitly and clears the listbox selection when a single selected entry is clicked again in `voice_gui_app.py`.)
- [x] When I select issues in one bucket, selections in the other buckets should clear unless I'm holding Ctrl. Right now selections stay active across buckets and make it hard to see what I'm moving. (Fixed: primary clicks clear selections in the other buckets unless Ctrl is held, in `voice_gui_app.py`.)
- [x] I can't hold control and select multiple issues anymore. I should be able to select multiple issues in one bucket and then drag those multiple issues into another bucket. (Fixed: `voice_gui_app.py` captures the active selection, prevents a toggle-only click from starting a drag, retains the highlight throughout the move, and re-selects the moved set in the destination bucket once dropped.) (completed 2025-12-23 15:38)
- [x] When the user select undo delete, it should undo the last delete. If they select undo delete again, it should undo the second last delete. It should be enumeration, so the undo delete button should enumerate through deleted items in the archive. (Fixed: undo delete now stacks archived batches and reapplies them one press at a time, logging remaining levels in `voice_gui_app.py`.) (completed 2025-12-23 15:38)
- [x] After dragging issues between buckets, `Ctrl+Z` should revert the move. (Fixed: drag pushes the sanitized file text to an undo stack and `Ctrl+Z` restores the previous snapshot so the move can be undone immediately.) (completed 2025-12-23 15:38)
- [x] I want you to add a ctrl-D function which will be a shortcut to the delete button next issue and issues. (Fixed: `voice_gui_app.py` binds `Ctrl+D` globally to the delete-selected flow and only triggers when a bucket has focus or selection.)
- [x] In dark mode, I can't see the writing of the input device selection field. The illumination in input devices or input lists in this application seems to default to a backdrop of like a grayish that's really conflicting with the white text in dark mode. So maybe just change that default backdrop to the same colors when an item has been selected from the list to fix this issue. (Fixed: combobox and dropdown list now follow the dark palette for background/foreground and selection colors in `voice_gui_app.py`.)
- [x] Also, the input device field shouldn't be so wide. I'll submit an image in the chat for you to refer to as a reference of how wide this should be. I'm just trying to tidy up the interface so that I can move things around a bit. (Fixed: device combobox width reduced and no longer expands to full row in `voice_gui_app.py`.)
- [x] When I also want the test selected mic button and the refresh button to be which I've selected in a green box, I want these to be moved over to next to the hot static string which I've indicated with an arrow. Once you've done that, (Fixed: Test Selected Mic + Refresh now sit beside the hotkeys info line in `voice_gui_app.py`.)
- [x] I want the waterfall window which I have eliminated in a purple square, I want that to be moved. Because you've changed the, you've shrunk things up a bit, I want you to move it up into the new, where, where the next purple boxes that I've created in the interface. So what this will do, they will actually make way for the log. And the issues. (Fixed: waterfall panel moved into the settings row right column and log moved into the lower section in `voice_gui_layout.py`/`voice_gui_app.py`.)
- [x] There's an issue when the, okay, so there should be a list of actions or a log of actions that have been carried out that are recorded in a log in the application. So, you know, attying the controls there, the undo function to just one set of actions isn't a global solution because if I hit control Z after I've deleted something, it's actually just moving items from one bucket to another, which I previously moved, and it's not actually undoing the delete. So instead of assigning the control Z function to one standalone action or set of actions, I want you to assign the control Z to a log of actions that have been carried out, and I want the control Z to be able to undo any action which I've carried out in the interface based on that log. Now, I'll let you decide as the expert on what kind of actions based on this current stack that could be, and then you need to also update the user interface agent to remember to tie in any new features to the action log so that there can be more global user actions from the control, from the shortcut keys tied in. (Fixed: `voice_gui_app.py` now captures snapshots for drag/move/delete/edit/reorder/remove-duplicates and `Ctrl+Z` replays the last action; `agents/AgentUi.md` updated to require new UI actions to log + register with undo.)
- [x] Another issue is that what I'm seeing is, when Codex is working through the issues, I can't actually see what issue it's currently working on because you need to populate, the workflow with the voice issues should be. It looks at all the issues, it contextualizes them briefly and puts a list point of items that it's going to start working on, and then it should start working through those list items. This will help push the real time interaction of the user as they use the application, they can track where things are going. And this only came to mind was because I can't actually see what the Codex agent is working on. So what I want you to do is also get the Codex agent to-- when it starts working on a task or an individual task, it should place a capital-- or it should place working on in the brackets of the pending issue in those closed brackets. There should be a text that says working on an issue that updates to the issues file. So this actually allows the user to be able to see what issues are currently being worked on actually in the voice issue recorder user interface. And then obviously as it checks off those issues, it will just obviously move it to the completed issues bucket as it works through each issue. So once it finishes working on an issue, it should revisit the issues MDE file and update it accordingly. (Fixed: workflow docs + scripts now require `[working on]` while in progress, and the UI treats that state as pending.)
- [x] There should be a listener that updates the buckets every time a change is made to the issues file. (Fixed: added a timed mtime watcher that refreshes the buckets whenever the issues file changes.)
