- [x] Reduced input device row padding/blank space while keeping selection readable. (device dropdown compact under paths; padding trimmed)
- [x] Cleaned placeholder/stray issue lines by normalizing the issues file into checklist items. (sanitizer writes normalized bullets)
- [x] , I want you to consider all of the issues that I've just addressed and I want you to consider all the features. And then I want you to use an expert analysis over my feature set and compare it to best market features that are trending that are similar to these kind of application, voice decoding interfaces and propose features that I haven't already considered in this tool that might be useful to implement as well. (feature proposals listed in latest reply)
- [x] The issue is that when I select a issue in the completed issues section, this issue will be the same in the pending issues section. So if I select the split issues pane into pending completed lists with select all and delete buttons, it only selects the first line. So if I select that first issue, it should select the five lines which contain that whole issue in itself. As opposed to just selecting one line from the pane, it should select, if I click one of the issues, it should select all the lines related to that standalone issue. (pending/completed list selections now expand to the whole wrapped issue)
- [x] Another issue is that there isn't really a clean workflow to streamline the issues to get hub. Apparently, you can upload issues to get hub and then that's more efficient for codecs. (added sync_github_issues.py to push unchecked backlog items to GitHub via gh)
- [x] GitHub supports CLI which means that we could do a capture the voice plus local STT and then persist the issues like GitHub issue create and then the agent consumes the issues from GitHub. It could actually follow the GitHub CLI which supports creating and listing issues from the terminal (gh helper lists existing issues and can create new ones from the voice backlog)
- [x] The microphone waterfall window should be twice the height that it is. The mic live red button should be over in the top right hand corner underneath the refresh button. (waterfall height doubled and live indicator moved under Refresh button)
- [x] There should be an option for the user to select multiple issues that have been marked off as completed, and then check them off as not completed, so to uncheck. This uncheck feature should be available below the completed issues window, and there should also be a check option in the pending issues window, so checked items will then move over to the completed issues and any unchecked items will also move over to the pending issues. This issue, the voice waterfall seems to get longer and longer as the user speaks more. The length of the waterfall should not change, it shouldn't scale, the total time that elapses through the waterfall pane should only be 5 seconds of recording time. Also the input device, (GUI now has Mark completed/Mark pending buttons that toggle between lists; waterfall history capped to ~5s so it no longer stretches over time)
- [x] There is an issue that when you select one issue that has been grouped, when you hit delete selected it counts the number of lines for that selected issue. For instance when I go to select removed my test header level, it says delete four pending issues when I've only selected one. (Deletion now deduplicates wrapped selections and counts unique issues only)
- [x] Ignore this issue. This is a test to see if the temporary file is deleted after transcription. (temp cleanup hardened)
- [x] The temporary files after transcription still are not being deleted. (temp WAVs removed after success, on failures during start, and during shutdown; stale .tmp files auto-pruned)
- [x] I want you to build the architecture in so that a transcription has some link to the temporary wave file that's it's used to create. One way you could do this is you could adopt the name of the wave file that the transcription comes from into the the issue when the transcription is finished you could refer to that name then and then carry out the delete or you could just simply put it to a pointer whatever method you find more efficient or you can think of you're an expert software architect and you will design the most efficient way to do this (appended audio filename to each recorded issue and log deletion of the temp WAV)
- [x] Also want an option in the pending and completed issues. I want an option for the user to be able to toggle the warning delete function off so that when the user deletes an issue it deletes right away if that toggle is active. (added skip delete confirmation toggle under the issues panel)
- [x] I want you to add another bucket from the issues pane or actually to the issues pane and in that bucket I want you to call this bucket wait list issues or features if it's possible also want you to do a drag and drop style function so that I can just drag and drop completed or pending issues into different buckets. (added Waitlist listbox with drag-drop between buckets plus move buttons)
- [x] This is to test the functionality of the temporary file deletion. (audio voice_gui_g1a84b4i.wav) (temp cleanup now runs after stop and prunes .tmp, with logs)
- [x] The temporary files still are not being deleted from the temporary folder after the audio has been transcribed into an issue. I want you to fix this. (audio voice_gui_3u97w6r0.wav) (post-transcription deletion tightened + stale cleanup)
- [x] , the input device selection pane should go underneath the issues file repo path hotkey toggle options and just be a simple drop down. Currently that window pane for input device is taking up and eating into the area of the microphone waterfall, the microphone waterfall should span the whole width of the window and there's no need for a selected input device. You can see what's selected when you select the input device and the input device drop down option. I want you to remove all of the padding around the drop down window. It should just be a simple drop down that doesn't take up so much of the room of the window. (audio voice_gui_3u97w6r0.wav) (dropdown compacted under path fields; padding removed; waterfall now expands full width)
- [x] , I want you to take, there's an individual button for mark completed, move to wait list on each of the pending issues completed in each of the bucket windows that contain the completed wait list and pending issues. It should just be a universal mark pending or mark completed or move to wait list that moves all of the selected items in any bucket to that selected window. (audio voice_gui_3u97w6r0.wav) (added global move buttons that act on selections in any bucket; per-bucket move buttons removed)
- [x] There is also an issue where the name of the audio file that it was transcribed from is put into the actual issue itself. That's kind of heavy compute and is unnecessary. The user doesn't actually need to see which audio voice recording is being used for the issue. I just want you to build in functionality or pointers in the code that ensures that once an issue is transcribed, the audio file that was used to transcribe that issue is deleted. (audio voice_gui_dx93f4go.wav) (issues no longer include audio filenames; temp WAVs deleted after success and cleaned on shutdown)
- [ ] This is a test to see that the transcribe file delete function has worked.
