- [x] You mentioned before that, if I wanted to have real-time feedback of what I'm saying in the application, I would need to plug it into a server. I want you to build this server out and run it as a native server using a Docker container that feeds back into the GUI. And then I want a speech output window that shows the speech that is being written into the application through the server. (added FastAPI relay server + Dockerfile, GUI speech output panel, websocket listener, and transcript posting on transcription)
