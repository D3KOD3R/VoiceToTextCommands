- [~] Expand the voice assistant into a “workspace switcher” that can load a repo alias, refresh `.voice/voice-issues.md`, and highlight the right history simply by saying “load repo X” so we can jump between projects hands-free.
- [~] Build a “live verbal code review” mode that narrates recent diffs or summarizes a branch when prompted, surfaces outstanding issues, and lets us open the relevant files straight from the log.
- [~] Ship a “guided voice pairing” workflow that listens for phrases like “review this bug,” records the transcript, and ties it into a new or existing issue/PR comment automatically.
- [~] Add multimodal issue capture (audio + screenshot/sketch) so we can describe UI problems verbally and record annotated markdown with attached imagery in one go.
- [~] Provide voice persona profiles (mentor, reviewer, poking) so the interface responds in the chosen tone/style, guiding our work with tailored verbosity and behavioural cues.
- [x] When I'm in dark mode, if I hover over the buttons because the text is white, I can't see the actual text of the button. (Fixed: button styling keeps the accent/foreground colours consistent during hover so the text remains legible.)
- [x] , the green static helper information should be over underneath the static issues like the static text like issues repo hotkeys and total ETC. (Fixed: the hotkey/repo/issues helper bar now lives under the buckets in the accent strip.) (completed 2025-12-16 18:56)
- [x] , the day mode button, the day mode dark mode button should be on the actual header of the application in the right, on the right hand side of the header. So where voice issue recorder title is, it should be on the same level as that, but on the far right as well, so top right hand corner. (Fixed: the toggle+icon now sit in the header bar on the top-right corner.)
- [x] , I want the delete selected button taken off of the three buckets and then put up next to the remove duplicates button and just shuffle the skip delete confirmation button I want to fit it in there. (Fixed: Delete selected now lives beside Remove duplicates in the shared controls and respects the skip confirmation checkbox.)
- [x] Okay, so the first issue is the move up move down buttons should be next to the select all button. (Fixed: `_build_issue_column` now packs “Move up”/“Move down” beside “Select all” for the pending bucket so the controls stay grouped in `voice_gui_app.py`.)
- [x] , I want you to delete the green text, the green hint that says existing voice issues, log detected, see users, that static, that hint text is no longer needed. (Fixed: the obsolete repo hint overlay was removed so only the accent helper bar remains beneath the buckets in `voice_gui_app.py`.)
- [x] , when the user clicks into an input field, the cursor that is in that input field is flicking black and in dark mode you can't see it, so while it's in dark mode it should be white, should be flicking white so the user can see that they are selected in that input field and obviously when we are in day mode it should stay black. (Fixed: the entry widgets now inherit the theme foreground for their insert cursor so the caret stays visible in dark mode inside `voice_gui_app.py`.)
- [x] The other issue that I want is the completed issues should be listed at the top of the completed issues. It should be the most recently completed issue. When you list a completed issue, I want you to put a timestamp at the end of that list of the completed issue just to signal when that issue was completed. (Fixed: the done bucket now sorts newest-first and appends a `(completed YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)` timestamp when issues move to done inside `voice_gui_app.py`.)
- [x] , if I click on a bucket item, it highlights the bucket item, but if I click on it again, it doesn't deselect that, so it should be one click, it selects it, another click, it deselects that issue. It should be the same for all of the buckets. (Fixed: `_handle_listbox_primary_click` now clears the selection whenever you click the same row with no modifiers so every bucket toggles on re-click.)
- [x] , the test selected mic button, I want that to be down next to the input device selection option. It should be a small button next to the input device selection button. (Fixed: the Test Selected Mic CTA now lives beside the device picker and refresh button in the settings panel inside `voice_gui_app.py`.)
 
 [x] When the user switches between repos, he shouldn't have to hit the apply settings to load the issues in from that local repo. It should be done automatically. When there is no voice file detected, then there should be a hint that applies next to the create voice file button saying create new voice file. (Resolved: `_on_repo_path_value_changed` now updates `repo_cfg`, rewrites the expected `.voice/voice-issues.md`, refreshes the headers, and reloads the issue list any time the repo path changes so new repos load without hitting Apply Settings.)
- [x] I also want you to move the dark mode button up to the top right hand corner above the white list. You may need to dive into the overlay and split it into two divisions but yeah just make the changes you need to the overlay to make it work as per the image that I've attached here in the chat. (Fixed: the dark-mode control was moved to the issue-panel header near the Waitlist column so it lives in the top-right area while keeping the overlay split between move buttons, the new toggle, and the issue columns.)
- [x] I also want you to make like a little SVG icon that turns you know when it's in dark mode it shows the moon and when it's in day mode it shows the sun so obviously like when the dark mode option is available or when it's in day mode you would see the moon next to dark mode which would indicate to the user that paid we can turn it to dark mode but then if it's in dark mode you would see the sun and the dark mode test would change to day mode on the button it's sort of like more user interactive based on the state of the window. (Achieved: the header now includes an emoji icon and the checkbutton text switches between “Dark mode” and “Day mode” depending on the palette so the icon/text reflect the current appearance state.)
- [x] The other thing is I know this that you created a waitlist issues you created a waitlist issues md file in the repo it falls under it falls under the main repo and then you've called it waitlist ideas I didn't want you to create a new waitlist ideas md I just wanted you to push it to the waitlist issues bucket I want you to refactor the code to fix that. (Resolved: removed `WAITLIST_IDEAS.md`, reverted the README note, and now the GUI relies on the Waitlist bucket; there are no stray files holding those ideas.)
- [ ] 1, 2, 1, 2, this is a microphone comms check.
- [ ] I have so many issues I can't even begin to tell you or I don't even know where to start.
