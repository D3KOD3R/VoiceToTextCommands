- [~] Expand the voice assistant into a "workspace switcher" that can load a repo alias, refresh `.voice/voice-issues.md`, and highlight the right history simply by saying "load repo X" so we can jump between projects hands-free. (Fixed: `voice_issue_daemon.py` now listens for `load repo <alias>`, updates `.voice_config.json`/`.voice/repo_history.json`, and continues with the remaining transcript so the next `fix issues` run follows the new project.)
- [~] Build a "live verbal code review" mode that narrates recent diffs or summarizes a branch when prompted, surfaces outstanding issues, and lets us open the relevant files straight from the log.
- [~] Ship a "guided voice pairing" workflow that listens for phrases like "review this bug," records the transcript, and ties it into a new or existing issue/PR comment automatically.
- [~] Add multimodal issue capture (audio + screenshot/sketch) so we can describe UI problems verbally and record annotated markdown with attached imagery in one go.
- [~] Provide voice persona profiles (mentor, reviewer, poking) so the interface responds in the chosen tone/style, guiding our work with tailored verbosity and behavioural cues.
- [~] - [ ] You are an expert in real-time voice recording. You should be able to design the real-time server within the application so that it doesn't cause the user's computer to use up too much RAM. The other thing is, the real-time server, it should be able to be stopped from inside the application as well. Let's focus on getting the real-time server working and seeing it put out its output in the pending issues bucket in real-time. So, it should be putting out the input in the real-time pickup in the pending issues bucket in real-time. And then when the user says stop recording, it saves that issue as it has been recorded. (Realtime host toggle + transcript sink in `voice_gui_app.py`, README notes, and `speech_server.py` capped backlog.)
