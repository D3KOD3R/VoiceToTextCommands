- [x] When the user switches between repos, he shouldn't have to hit the apply settings to load the issues in from that local repo. It should be done automatically. When there is no voice file detected, then there should be a hint that applies next to the create voice file button saying create new voice file. (Resolved: `_on_repo_path_value_changed` now updates `repo_cfg`, rewrites the expected `.voice/voice-issues.md`, refreshes the headers, and reloads the issue list any time the repo path changes so new repos load without hitting Apply Settings.)
- [x] I also want you to move the dark mode button up to the top right hand corner above the white list. You may need to dive into the overlay and split it into two divisions but yeah just make the changes you need to the overlay to make it work as per the image that I've attached here in the chat. (Fixed: the dark-mode control was moved to the issue-panel header near the Waitlist column so it lives in the top-right area while keeping the overlay split between move buttons, the new toggle, and the issue columns.)
- [x] I also want you to make like a little SVG icon that turns you know when it's in dark mode it shows the moon and when it's in day mode it shows the sun so obviously like when the dark mode option is available or when it's in day mode you would see the moon next to dark mode which would indicate to the user that paid we can turn it to dark mode but then if it's in dark mode you would see the sun and the dark mode test would change to day mode on the button it's sort of like more user interactive based on the state of the window. (Achieved: the header now includes an emoji icon and the checkbutton text switches between “Dark mode” and “Day mode” depending on the palette so the icon/text reflect the current appearance state.)
- [x] The other thing is I know this that you created a waitlist issues you created a waitlist issues md file in the repo it falls under it falls under the main repo and then you've called it waitlist ideas I didn't want you to create a new waitlist ideas md I just wanted you to push it to the waitlist issues bucket push those ideas to the waitlist issues bucket I want you to refactor the code to fix that. (Resolved: removed `WAITLIST_IDEAS.md`, reverted the README note, and now the GUI relies on the Waitlist bucket; there are no stray files holding those ideas.)
