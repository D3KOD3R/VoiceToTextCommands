- [x] You mentioned before that, if I wanted to have real-time feedback of what I'm saying in the application, I would need to plug it into a server. I want you to build this server out and run it as a native server using a Docker container that feeds back into the GUI. And then I want a speech output window that shows the speech that is being written into the application through the server. (added FastAPI relay server + Dockerfile, GUI speech output panel, websocket listener, and transcript posting on transcription)
- [x] This is a check to see that the server is running. I don't see. I don't see that the server is running. There should be an online input. It doesn't matter if the server is tied to the in-built starting of the application. The server itself, the speech translation server, should be running outside of the paying issues or the actual issue of donation mechanism. The server's job is purely to tie back what the speaker is saying in real time in a separate speech output window. (added Start/Stop server buttons with status, optional auto-start from config; speech output panel remains separate)
- [x] there is also another issue when I go to drag an item if the window is like is minimized the the drag causes the view window of the the bucket that it's in to scroll across the issues itself should shrink to the size of the window by wrapping and re-wrapping based on the size of the user interface so that you don't have this scrolling issue when you drag and drop between windows next issue is also that all of the voice the repo issues and hotkeys static text that is in the top left-hand corner I want this moved down to below the test selected mic button on the right hand side and in you know the the div should start 50% so in the middle so that it doesn't enter into the room where the hotkey toggle repo path and issues file pass input device are sitting so again to reiterate the repo issues and hotkeys static text I want that moved down to the right window pane below the the test selected mic so it should be inserted into a div which contains the hotkey toggle repo path issues file input device and the microphone selection so in the left hand side of this division you'll have the microphone selection input device issues file repo path hotkey toggle and the right hand side of the division which will be split it horizontally into two different sections you will have the repo issues and hotkeys static text once this has been completed this will open up room for the pending issues and completed issues and waitlist issues buckets to take up more room and basically I want you to spread those three buckets over the entire width of the window and sitting in one bucket so each window should take up roughly one third of the width of the general user interface. (info text moved to right column below test button; issue buckets span full width; dynamic wrap width to avoid horizontal scroll on drag)
