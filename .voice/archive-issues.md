- [x] When the user selects any issue from any bucket, they should be able to click on that issue again and it will deselect that issue. The other thing is the user should be able to select multiple issues from any bucket and then when they click and hold, they should be able to drag multiple issues into different buckets. (Fixed: re-click deselect already in place; drag now moves multiple selected issues.)

- [ ] There is an issue where even though I've selected multiple issues in one bucket, when I go to drag them over, because I've selected one point in the bucket, it only drags from the point or the issue that I've selected to drag that over. So I want you to fix this by putting a catch case where if I have multiple issues selected, it waits for a full press and then release of the button. So if I have multiple issues selected, it should go into a catch phrase where it allows the user to drag those multiple issues while they're holding the main click button in. And then when they release the click button, it drops depending where the pointer is, it drops those issues in the bucket. Again, what it is doing and the problem is that when they select multiple issues, as soon as I go to drag those multiple issues across to the next bucket, the select function is overriding the multiple selection and just selecting back to the single issue where they click on. I want you to think carefully about how you can fix this issue with catch statements. The other thing is

- [x] I can't hit select one issue by clicking on an issue in any of the buckets. I should be able to deselect that issue by clicking on it again, so that needs to be fixed. I need to be able to click on an issue. It will illuminate and then if I click on the illuminated issue again, it will un-illuminate that issue. (Fixed: `voice_gui_app.py` clears the current selection before applying the click and selection expansion now respects the actual state, so re-clicking toggles the highlight.) (completed 2025-12-23 13:16)

- [x] When the user select undo delete, it should undo the last delete. If they select undo delete again, it should undo the second last delete. It should be enumeration, so the undo delete button should enumerate through deleted items in the archive. (Fixed: undo delete now stacks archived batches and reapplies them one press at a time, logging remaining levels in `voice_gui_app.py`.) (completed 2025-12-23 13:15)

- [x] I can't hold control and select multiple issues anymore. I should be able to select multiple issues in one bucket and then drag those multiple issues into another bucket. (Fixed: `voice_gui_app.py` recalculates the dragged entries after the selection settles so ctrl/shift selections remain intact when moved.)

I need to be able to click on an issue. It will illuminate and then if I click on the illuminated issue again, it will un-illuminate that issue. (Fixed: `voice_gui_app.py` clears the current selection, suppresses the release event, and now prevents Tk's default re-selection so a second click really deselects the entry.)
- [ ] After dragging issues between buckets, `Ctrl+Z` should revert the move. (Fixed: drag pushes the sanitized file text to an undo stack and `Ctrl+Z` restores the previous snapshot so the move can be undone immediately.)

## Pending archive 2025-12-23 17:16
- [ ] There is an issue where now if I select multiple items and then go to drag and drop, when I start the drag, it deselects the issue. So you need to create a listener so that it's a full click. If there's a click and a hold, it doesn't unselect that issue and allows the drag to still commence.

- [ ] is I want the user to be able to, when they save a file, there's a window that says file saved. I want a checkbox that allows the user to select the checkbox and says don't notify me again. If the user selects that, it just locks and saves that user setting as not to show notifications. It locks it in, saves that in the user settings.
- [ ] , I want the configuration of the pane, like how the user has changed the grids. I want that configuration to be saved in the user's file settings. Again, like all these actual file settings, there should be a git ignore on the file settings themselves, but the functionality and the scaffolding should still be there.

- [working on] There is a serious issue that when I'm working in other repos and I tell the application, fix issues, the agent is asking me questions. It should just start working through the issues that I've given it in the list. Why does it keep asking me questions, and also how can I strengthen the structure so that it refers and follows through that workflow. Have there been any substantial changes to the issues workflow file recently that have used to work a lot better, and for some reason now it just does not work as well. It only started sort of going backwards in the last day or two. It used to work really strongly, I could just type into the codecs chart, fix issues, and then it would start working through the list. We need to fix this.

- [ ] I want a settings option that the user can assign hotkeys for any function in the canvas panel. There should be a drop down that says settings and then in settings the user can then assign hotkeys. Now if the user assigns different hotkeys those hotkeys should be updated in the hints. The hints that are assigned to those functions. Now I know that when you select there's a drop down that shows some colors for each function. Let's just not worry about those functions in the hotkey settings for now like the actual drawing functions.

- [x] In dark mode, I can't see the writing of the input device selection field. The illumination in input devices or input lists in this application seems to default to a backdrop of like a grayish that's really conflicting with the white text in dark mode. So maybe just change that default backdrop to the same colors when an item has been selected from the list to fix this issue. (Fixed: combobox and dropdown list now follow the dark palette for background/foreground and selection colors in `voice_gui_app.py`.)

## Completed archive 2025-12-23 19:30
- [x] Also, the input device field shouldn't be so wide. I'll submit an image in the chat for you to refer to as a reference of how wide this should be. I'm just trying to tidy up the interface so that I can move things around a bit. (Fixed: device combobox width reduced and no longer expands to full row in `voice_gui_app.py`.)

- [x] I want the waterfall window which I have eliminated in a purple square, I want that to be moved. Because you've changed the, you've shrunk things up a bit, I want you to move it up into the new, where, where the next purple boxes that I've created in the interface. So what this will do, they will actually make way for the log. And the issues. (Fixed: waterfall panel moved into the settings row right column and log moved into the lower section in `voice_gui_layout.py`/`voice_gui_app.py`.)

## Completed archive 2025-12-23 19:30
- [x] There's an issue when the, okay, so there should be a list of actions or a log of actions that have been carried out that are recorded in a log in the application. So, you know, attying the controls there, the undo function to just one set of actions isn't a global solution because if I hit control Z after I've deleted something, it's actually just moving items from one bucket to another, which I previously moved, and it's not actually undoing the delete. So instead of assigning the control Z function to one standalone action or set of actions, I want you to assign the control Z to a log of actions that have been carried out, and I want the control Z to be able to undo any action which I've carried out in the interface based on that log. Now, I'll let you decide as the expert on what kind of actions based on this current stack that could be, and then you need to also update the user interface agent to remember to tie in any new features to the action log so that there can be more global user actions from the control, from the shortcut keys tied in. (Fixed: `voice_gui_app.py` now captures snapshots for drag/move/delete/edit/reorder/remove-duplicates and `Ctrl+Z` replays the last action; `agents/AgentUi.md` updated to require new UI actions to log + register with undo.)

## Completed archive 2025-12-23 19:31
- [x] Another issue is that what I'm seeing is, when Codex is working through the issues, I can't actually see what issue it's currently working on because you need to populate, the workflow with the voice issues should be. It looks at all the issues, it contextualizes them briefly and puts a list point of items that it's going to start working on, and then it should start working through those list items. This will help push the real time interaction of the user as they use the application, they can track where things are going. And this only came to mind was because I can't actually see what the Codex agent is working on. So what I want you to do is also get the Codex agent to-- when it starts working on a task or an individual task, it should place a capital-- or it should place working on in the brackets of the pending issue in those closed brackets. There should be a text that says working on an issue that updates to the issues file. So this actually allows the user to be able to see what issues are currently being worked on actually in the voice issue recorder user interface. And then obviously as it checks off those issues, it will just obviously move it to the completed issues bucket as it works through each issue. So once it finishes working on an issue, it should revisit the issues MDE file and update it accordingly. (Fixed: workflow docs + scripts now require `[working on]` while in progress, and the UI treats that state as pending.)

- [x] Preserve multi-selection state when dragging and clicking within the issue buckets so Ctrl/Drag stays highlighted and repeated clicks toggle selection without losing the other entries. (Fixed in voice_gui_app.py)
- [x] I can't hit select one issue by clicking on an issue in any of the buckets. I should be able to deselect that issue by clicking on it again, so that needs to be fixed. I need to be able to click on an issue. It will illuminate and then if I click on the illuminated issue again, it will un-illuminate that issue. (Fixed: click handling now manages selection explicitly and clears the listbox selection when a single selected entry is clicked again in `voice_gui_app.py`.)
- [x] When I select issues in one bucket, selections in the other buckets should clear unless I'm holding Ctrl. Right now selections stay active across buckets and make it hard to see what I'm moving. (Fixed: primary clicks clear selections in the other buckets unless Ctrl is held, in `voice_gui_app.py`.)
- [x] I can't hold control and select multiple issues anymore. I should be able to select multiple issues in one bucket and then drag those multiple issues into another bucket. (Fixed: `voice_gui_app.py` captures the active selection, prevents a toggle-only click from starting a drag, retains the highlight throughout the move, and re-selects the moved set in the destination bucket once dropped.) (completed 2025-12-23 15:38)
- [x] When the user select undo delete, it should undo the last delete. If they select undo delete again, it should undo the second last delete. It should be enumeration, so the undo delete button should enumerate through deleted items in the archive.

- [x] I want you to add a ctrl-D function which will be a shortcut to the delete button next issue and issues. (Fixed: `voice_gui_app.py` binds `Ctrl+D` globally to the delete-selected flow and only triggers when a bucket has focus or selection.)
- [x] In dark mode, I can't see the writing of the input device selection field. The illumination in input devices or input lists in this application seems to default to a backdrop of like a grayish that's really conflicting with the white text in dark mode.

- [x] There should be a listener that updates the buckets every time a change is made to the issues file. (Fixed: added a timed mtime watcher that refreshes the buckets whenever the issues file changes.)
- [x] Issue one, I want you to resize the microphone waterfall so that it consumes all of that extra space now. (Fixed: waterfall canvas height increased so the mic view fills the newly freed area in the settings panel in `voice_gui_app.py`.)
- [x] I want you to delete the static lines that I've placed in the red box. (Fixed: the static helper info strip was removed so the settings area only shows the controls now.)
- [x] I want you to change the title of hotkey toggle to record toggle and I want you to change the hotkey quit to rename it to delete the hotkey quit function altogether and that input field which is underlined. Again I'll repeat I want you to delete the hotkey quit functionality and that input field. (Fixed: the hotkey toggle label now reads “Record toggle” and the quit field was removed so only the toggle entry remains in `voice_gui_app.py`.)
- [x] I want the stop and transcribe button to be deleted and I want the functionality rolled into the start recording button because the user should be able to click the start recording button and then it's recording obviously so then the text of the start recording button should just change to stop and transcribe and then I want you to look at image 4 and you'll see that I want the start recording button. I want it to be moved up next to… actually now because the stop and transcribe functionality has been rolled into the one button the start record stop and transcribe in one button. I want you to then move that button up to where the static text was so it should just span where the green arrows are. And then because of that you'll see on image 4 you'll see there'll be more room now for the log window to move up as well. So that's the log window should feel that extra space. Thank you. (Fixed: the single Start Recording button now toggles to Stop & Transcribe, lives in the settings panel where the static text used to be, and the log area above the enlarged waterfall now fills that freed space while the action row only hosts the status indicator in `voice_gui_app.py`/`voice_gui_layout.py`.)
- [x] - [x] - [x] I want you to first reduce the size of the stop and transcribe button. It should be contained in the same window as record toggle repo path issues file input device. I want you to refactor the code a bit so that items are held in containers, so that when you're moving stuff around, the items have a flexible or shrink to that container size. Essentially, I want the stop and transcribe button to be the same length, like the end of it should end where the mic/live edge is. (Fixed: equal column weights keep the controls container flexible, the record toggle row shares the settings space with the new containerized layout, and the button width now aligns with the microphone/waterfall edge in `voice_gui_layout.py`/`voice_gui_app.py`.)
- [x] There is a serious issue that when I'm working in other repos and I tell the application, fix issues, the agent is asking me questions. It should just start working through the issues that I've given it in the list. Why does it keep asking me questions, and also how can I strengthen the structure so that it refers and follows through that workflow.

We need to fix this. (Fixed: codex_review_issues.* now resolve the repo-local issues file via scripts/resolve_voice_issues.py and .voice_config.json, so the companion agent always follows the active repo.)

And then because of that you'll see on image 4 you'll see there'll be more room now for the log window to move up as well. So that's the log window should feel that extra space. Thank you. (Fixed: the single Start Recording button now toggles to Stop & Transcribe, lives in the settings panel where the static text used to be, and the log area above the enlarged waterfall now fills that freed space while the action row only hosts the status indicator in `voice_gui_app.py`/`voice_gui_layout.py`.)
- [x] - [x] - [x] I want you to first reduce the size of the stop and transcribe button. It should be contained in the same window as record toggle repo path issues file input device. I want you to refactor the code a bit so that items are held in containers, so that when you're moving stuff around, the items have a flexible or shrink to that container size. Essentially, I want the stop and transcribe button to be the same length, like the end of it should end where the mic/live edge is. (Fixed: equal column weights keep the controls container flexible, the record toggle row shares the settings space with the new containerized layout, and the button width now aligns with the microphone/waterfall edge in `voice_gui_layout.py`/`voice_gui_app.py`.)
- [x] There is a serious issue that when I'm working in other repos and I tell the application, fix issues, the agent is asking me questions. It should just start working through the issues that I've given it in the list. Why does it keep asking me questions, and also how can I strengthen the structure so that it refers and follows through that workflow. Have there been any substantial changes to the issues workflow file recently that have used to work better, and for some reason now it just does not work as well. It only started sort of going backwards in the last day or two. It used to work really strongly, I could just type into the codecs chart, fix issues, and then it would start working through the list. We need to fix this. (Fixed: codex_review_issues.* now resolve the repo-local issues file via scripts/resolve_voice_issues.py and .voice_config.json, so the companion agent always follows the active repo.)

- [ ] I want to start working on the live server transcription. So the waterfall should still feed into the same, the waterfall should feed from the live server. I want an indicator that shows, actually I disregard I already have a indicator that shows if the real-time server is running. Let's focus on getting the real-time server being able to run from within the terminal. I want an option to be able to start the real-time server. If the real-time server is running, it should be assumed that the recording is coming from the real-time server.

- [x] Refer to image one: make the Start Recording button match the green box, keep those controls grouped inside the invisible blue box container, and stretch the microphone waterfall so it aligns with the purple area beside that container. (Fixed: the settings panel now wraps the controls in a dedicated container, the Start Recording button is sized and aligned within that container, and the waterfall canvas height was increased so the mic view lines up with the adjacent column.)

- [x] With the extra space freed up by those adjustments, expand the log window to fill the red box area so the log has the full width shown in the reference. (Fixed: the log area now uses a taller ScrolledText widget and the layout weights allocate more vertical space to the log row so the log stretches across the entire bottom band.)

- [x] The first thing I want you to do is to look within the folder, the repo and look for anything related to voice issues agent. Now there's a file called voice issues agent dot MD in the agents folder. There's also a dot voice folder with an issues workflow, voice issues workflow. Then there's an agent voice dot MD as well. Now there's a lot of double up of different folders over the place. What I want you to do is read through all the folders related to these agent voices in the repo and I want you to consolidate all of those points. If there's a double up on these points, they need to be all put into one folder or one, they all need to be put into one agent in the agents folder. Now that agent will be the voice issues agent. Now, we've also got, there's a voice issues agent in the agent folder and then you've got agent voice as well. There's a lot of double up of the agent voice agent rules. I want you to go through the whole repo and consolidate every single point into the one file. Once you've done that, check back in with me and show me all the files that you detected in relation to workflows and voice agent instructions and how you've consolidated them all into one document. I want you to take your time with this and be thorough and then we can focus on restructuring base around that one file where you've consolidated. (Consolidated into `agents/VoiceIssuesAgent.md`, removed the duplicate agent files, and updated `Agents.md`, `config/gitignore_rules.json`, and the GUI/app references.)

- [ ] - [ ] , when I hover over a tool, the option to change colors on the tooling now is broken. It doesn't work. I want you to look at past commits and see where this may have broken or become affected. It just has that little circle thing showing up again.

- [x] I want the waterfall window to take up this whole section here. I'll indicate with a red rectangle. Actually, it'll be an orange rectangle. The waterfall should take up this space here. The bottom of the waterfall should fall in line more or less with the bottom of the Stop and Transcribe button. Once you've done that, I want the hide of the log window to be moved up to here. I also want you to move the real-time server detection next to the Stop and Transcribe. I want you to remove the recording text as well that I've highlighted. (Boosted the settings row height, let the settings row stretch, and increased the canvas minimum height so the waterfall matches the reference; status sits above the log and realtime controls stay next to Start/Stop.)
- [x] Waterfall panel still does not stretch left to match the mock; widen the waterfall column and remove extra left padding so the canvas aligns with the section edge. (Adjusted column weights and left padding in `voice_gui_layout.py`/`voice_gui_app.py`.)
